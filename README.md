This repository contains all results obtaied by Nicola Bianchessi and Emanuele Tresoldi on the dataset for the Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem with Conflicts proposed by Kowalczyk, D. and Leus, R. in Kowalczyk, D. and Leus, R. (2017). "An exact algorithm for parallel machine scheduling with conflicts". Journal of Scheduling,20(4), 355â€“372.

A complete description of the procedures used to find these result is reported in Bianchessi, N. and Tresoldi, E. "A stand-alone branch-and-price algorithm for identical parallel machinescheduling with conflicts". Computers and Operations Research, to appear.
